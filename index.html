        <p class="para">The habit of reading books was cultivated when I was a kid. I used to read lots of small story books then. But as I grew, my choice also grew and now I like reading more of books and articles that gives me more information and knowledge. Reading is not only a wonderful hobby, but one that enables us to acquire so much knowledge, much beyond what we could ever imagine of. A person who reads would be aware almost of all facts and happenings around them. They would be in knowledge with lots of facts and figures that would help them in the long run.
